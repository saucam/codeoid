/**
 * Shared pending-approval lookup for ApprovalBar + desktop notifications.
 *
 * The naive version scanned the ENTIRE message array from index 0 on every
 * streaming delta — O(N) per delta on a 5 000-message session. Two levers
 * keep this cheap while preserving user-visible behavior:
 *
 *   1. Status gate. Approvals can only pend mid-turn, so when the session
 *      is `idle` / `error` there is nothing to find and we skip the scan
 *      entirely. We deliberately gate on "any active status" rather than
 *      strictly `waiting_approval`: with parallel pending approvals (rare,
 *      stream-input mode) the daemon flips status to `tool_running` /
 *      `thinking` the moment the FIRST approval resolves even though a
 *      second is still waiting (session.ts resolves each canUseTool with
 *      `setStatus(approved ? "tool_running" : "thinking")`), and a strict
 *      gate would hide that second approval bar forever — deadlocking the
 *      turn from the user's point of view.
 *
 *   2. Turn-bounded backward scan. Pending approvals live in the CURRENT
 *      turn — every earlier turn's tool calls were finalized (executing /
 *      cancelled) before the next user message could be accepted. So scan
 *      backward from the tail and stop at the first `user` message. Within
 *      that window the OLDEST pending match wins, matching the previous
 *      forward-scan semantics (the daemon serializes approvals oldest
 *      first).
