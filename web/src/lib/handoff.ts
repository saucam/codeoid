/**
 * URL-hash credential handoff for embed SSO.
 *
 * An embedding parent (e.g. Highflame Studio) can pre-authenticate this
 * embedded UI by handing a SHORT-LIVED credential in the URL *hash* — never
 * the query string. The hash is not sent to any server, does not appear in the
 * `Referer` header, and is not logged by intermediaries, so it is the safe
 * channel for a bearer credential the parent already holds.
 *
 * ── Trusted-framing-origin gate (login-CSRF / session-fixation defense) ──
 * Reading a credential out of `location.hash` unconditionally is credential
 * *injection*: an attacker can lure a victim to `…/ui/#codeoid_token=<attacker
 * JWT>` (top-level navigation) or frame this app from an attacker page and
 * silently sign the victim into the ATTACKER's account. Stripping the hash on
 * consume and never sending it to the server defend *leakage* — they do
 * nothing against injection. So we consume a hash-delivered credential ONLY
 * when this page is EMBEDDED by an allowlisted parent origin, and we fail
 * CLOSED on any uncertainty:
 *   1. Not framed (`window.top === window.self`) ⇒ ignore the hash. This kills
 *      the top-level-navigation login-CSRF outright.
 *   2. Framing origin (`location.ancestorOrigins[0]`) absent (e.g. Firefox has
 *      no `ancestorOrigins`) ⇒ ignore. We do NOT fall back to
 *      `document.referrer`, which an embedding page can strip or forge.
 *   3. Framing origin not in the configured allowlist ⇒ ignore.
 * Only when ALL pass do we consume + persist + strip. An ungated call never
 * writes to storage, so it can never clobber an existing valid session; a
 * gated call was authorized by a trusted parent, so replacing the stored
 * credential within the gate is intended.
 *
 * The daemon publishes the allowlist to the client as the synchronous global
 * `window.__CODEOID_EMBED_ORIGINS__` (injected into the served index.html —
 * see src/frontends/web-ui/index.ts). Empty/absent ⇒ NO origin is trusted ⇒
 * the hash handoff is effectively disabled (the safe default).
 *
 * On a passing gate we CONSUME it: read the two known keys, persist them
 * exactly like the normal sign-in flows (into the same localStorage slots),
 * and immediately strip them from the URL via `history.replaceState` so the
 * credential does not linger in the address bar or browser history. The daemon
 * still verifies the token on the WS handshake and fails closed — this only
 * changes how the browser OBTAINS a token, not the security gate.
 *
 * Accepted hash params (ONLY these two — anything else is ignored/preserved):
 *   #codeoid_token=<JWT>       → persisted as the OAuth JWT (codeoid.token)
 *   #codeoid_key=<zid_sk_...>  → persisted as the API key   (codeoid.apiKey)
 *
 * SECURITY: only the two known keys are accepted; the credential value is never
 * logged; and it is stripped from the URL on the same tick it is read. The
 * parent is expected to hand a SHORT-LIVED token for this to be a safe SSO
 * bridge — a long-lived secret in a hash is a durable-credential leak.
