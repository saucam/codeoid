/**
 * Target context-window resolution for cross-backend history seeding.
 *
 * When a session forks or switches onto another backend, its conversation is
 * replayed to the new backend as a prompt-prefix "seed" (see
 * renderHistorySeed). The seed must fit the TARGET model's context window —
 * so we size it to that window and only truncate when the history genuinely
 * doesn't fit (and surface it when we do).
 *
 * The numbers are HYBRID (per the design decision):
 *   1. Exact per-model window when we know the model — Claude via the shared
 *      MODEL_CATALOG, a few high-confidence non-Claude families below.
 *   2. Otherwise a conservative per-provider DEFAULT — used at fork/seed time,
 *      when the exact target model isn't chosen yet (a cross-backend fork
 *      resets to the new provider's default model), or for unknown models.
 *
 * Conservative-by-design: under-estimating a window over-truncates (safe, and
 * surfaced); over-estimating risks overflowing the model's real window (breaks
 * the turn). Refine entries here as real numbers are confirmed, or later from
 * provider-reported ModelInfo.
