/**
 * Hook bus types — codeoid's daemon-native hook layer.
 *
 * pi's in-process extension hooks (tool_call block/mutate, lifecycle) only
 * help pi sessions. The HookBus gives EVERY backend the same user-pluggable
 * extensibility, keyed by the provider-neutral events the daemon already
 * sees: a "block writes to .env" or "git-checkpoint per turn" rule applies
 * uniformly whether the session runs on claude, pi, gemini, or openai.
 *
 * Hooks are config-declared (`hooks.entries` in config.json) — no plugin
 * loading machinery. Two kinds in v1, both mirroring Claude Code's hook
 * contract so users can reuse mental models:
 *
 *   - `command`: spawn a shell command with the event JSON on stdin.
 *     Exit 0 → stdout may carry a JSON outcome; exit 2 → block (stderr is
 *     the reason); anything else → non-blocking failure (logged, hook
 *     ignored). An in-process JS plugin kind is deliberately NOT offered —
 *     that's a much bigger security surface; a future kind can add it.
 *   - `webhook`: POST the event JSON; a 2xx response body may carry the
 *     same JSON outcome. Non-2xx / network errors are non-blocking.
 *
 * Fail-open by design for INFRA failures (a crashed hook script must not
 * brick every session); blocking is always an EXPLICIT hook decision
 * (exit 2 or `{"decision":"block"}`).
