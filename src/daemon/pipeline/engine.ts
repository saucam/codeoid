/**
 * The pipeline advance logic.
 *
 * Pure over (PipelineState × registries): `step()` moves one phase forward
 * (promote → optional entry gate → run kind → exit gate → transition) and
 * returns a NEW state; `run()` loops `step()` until the pipeline is terminal or
 * halted, invoking `onProgress` after each step so the caller can persist.
 *
 * Persistence, identity, worker sessions, and frontend surfacing are NOT here —
 * they compose around this in PipelineManager (and later slices). Keeping the
 * transition rules side-effect-free is exactly what makes them unit-testable.
